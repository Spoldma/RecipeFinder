# RecipeFinder

**RecipeFinder** is a smart kitchen assistant that helps you decide what to cook based on what you already have in your fridge.  
The project uses **object detection** to recognize ingredients from a photo you take of your fridge or kitchen items, then suggests relevant recipes you can make from them. The system includes a lightweight user interface and a custom-trained YOLOv8 model to identify food items and match them with recipes from a dataset.
