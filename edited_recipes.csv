we use it to marinade our beef for shish-ke-bab. use a really good grade of curry, it makes or breaks the recipe. east indian is best, but asian will do. you can use round steak, if you want, the marinating will tenderize it. also, if i may suggest someone trying lamb?
i always triple the curry and double the onion, garlic and ginger. we really *love* curry...
prep time does not include overnight marinating. cooking time is an estimation. total time will depend on what type of meat you are using, how big your meat cubes are and the size and consistency of your veg.
this isn't as complex as it looks as it is mostly a matter of organization. give it a try!","['beef', 'beer', 'canola oil', 'onion', 'curry powder', 'minced ginger', 'garlic', 'round steak', 'bell peppers', 'white pearl onions', 'roma tomatoes', 'ginger']",12
